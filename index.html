    how are you doing?<br>
    basic meaningless question!<br>
    and the most useful<br>
    <br>
    when comfy all day<br>
    it's like you may as well have<br>
    never woken up<br>
    <br>
    cavern of desire<br>
    i'd explore it gleefully<br>
    until i turn back<br>
    <br>
    humans to be used<br>
    as fuel for my machine that's<br>
    designed to fuel them<br>
    <br>
    raging at others<br>
    because they keep us from what<br>
    holds little value<br>
    <br>
    beautiful garden<br>
    each flower contained within<br>
    needs only a bit<br>
    <br>
