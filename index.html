      hello, how are you?<br>
      boring uninspired question!<br>
      and the most useful<br>
      <br>
      nothing to nothing<br>
      i can make the most of it<br>
      and not know it ends<br>
      <br>
      when comfy all day<br>
      i gave my brain what it wants!<br>
      and never woke up<br>
      <br>
      cavern of desire<br>
      i'd explore it gleefully<br>
      until i turn back<br>
      <br>
      humans to be used<br>
      as fuel for my machine that's<br>
      made to power them<br>
      <br>
      raging at others<br>
      because they keep us from what<br>
      holds little value<br>
      <br>
      beautiful garden<br>
      each flower contained within<br>
      needs only a bit<br>
      <br>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id = "column2">
      <p>
      why should i progress?<br>
      to benefit my future!<br>
      but mostly my now<br>
      <br>
      having been stupid<br>
      i lost what i treasured most<br>
      and learned it was trash<br>
      <br>
      searching for pleasure<br>
      a chill game or yummy food<br>
      will not do a thing<br>
      <br>
      my name, what is it?<br>
      not the ones i gave myself<br>
      it's always been there<br>
      <br>
