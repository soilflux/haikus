      how are you doing?<br>
      boring uninspired question!<br>
      and the most useful<br>
      <br>
      nothing to nothing<br>
      we can make the most of it<br>
      and not know it ends<br>
      <br>
      when comfy all day<br>
      it's like you may as well have<br>
      never woken up<br>
      <br>
      cavern of desire<br>
      i'd explore it gleefully<br>
      until i turn back<br>
      <br>
      humans to be used<br>
      as fuel for my machine that's<br>
      made to power them<br>
      <br>
      raging at others<br>
      because they keep us from what<br>
      holds little value<br>
      <br>
      beautiful garden<br>
      each flower contained within<br>
      needs only a bit<br>
